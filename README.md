##Hi there! 👋
#I'm Mosammad Kabir, a Software Engineer and AI enthusiast. 👩‍💻
I am a Computer Science major at Brooklyn College with a passion for building robust, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

I have hands-on experience in full-stack development and AI automation, having completed a Software Engineer Intern at Cognizant and an AI & Automation Externship at Outamation.

My work in AI includes building a RAG pipeline from scratch and developing conversational AI applications using modern frameworks and models. I am actively looking for software engineering roles where I can apply my skills in full-stack development and machine learning to build impactful products.
